HTC ONE m9
With a premium all-metal unibody, the beautiful HTC One M9 doesn't stray away from HTC's 
gorgeous design tradition for its flagship line. For the first time in recent memory, we 
are also getting a high-res rear camera on an HTC finest - a 20 MP shooter - while the 
UltraPixel camera is moved at the front for perfect selfies. Add a scorching Snapdragon 
810 chipset, 3 GB of DDR4 RAM, and 32 GB of storage out of the box, and the One M9 
quickly elevates HTC to competitive status with any other phone thrown at it, and we 
didn't even mention the new BoomSound speakers with Dolby surround sound at the front.
